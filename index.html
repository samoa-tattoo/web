            <h1>MALU</h1>
            <p>The Malu is the traditional Samoan tattoo for women. It is a sacred and cultural symbol that represents a womanâ€™s role in her family and community. The Malu usually covers the thighs and sometimes extends to the knees. It is made up of delicate, fine patterns and is done by a tufuga ta tatau (the tattoo master). In Samoan culture, wearing the Malu shows that a woman is ready to serve, lead with respect, and carry her cultural responsibilities with pride. It is not just a tattoo, it is an honor and a deep connection to heritage and identity.</p>

            <h1>PE'A</h1>
            <p>The Pe'a is a traditional male tattoo in Samoa. It covers the body from the waist to the knees and is a symbol of courage, honor, and cultural pride. The tattoo is made using special tools and can take many days to complete. This shows that a man is ready to serve his family and community. The process is painful and shows strength and dedication. The Pe'a is done by a traditional tattoo artist called a tufuga ta tatau. The designs are made using handmade tools and ink, passed down through generations. Wearing a Pe'a is a great honor. It comes with responsibility to live with respect, humility, and service to others. Those who finish the tattoo are often called soga'imiti.</p>
